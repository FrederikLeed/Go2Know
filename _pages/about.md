## Why blog?

The primary purpose of my blog is to serve as a repository for various guides and scripts that I have compiled over time. It is a virtual space where I can easily access my own solutions and also share the solutions I have developed either independently or in conjunction with other like-minded individuals.

Writing blog posts about solutions has a positive impact on the quality of my work, as well as on the reusability of my code.

## About me

>"I am in fact a Hobbit in all but size. I like gardens, trees, and unmechanized farmlands; I smoke a pipe, and like good plain food...and I believe that  legends and myths are largely made of 'truth', and indeed present aspects of it that can only be received in this mode; and long ago certain truths and modes of this kind were discovered and must always reappear."  --J.R.R. Tolkien

A great quote from Tolkien about the Hobbits simple life. This goes for me as well. (allthough I do not smoke pipe, I do like the concept of it. Something peacefull)

### Personal interests

The lovely Wife, the wonderfull kids, the dog. Family first. Always!

#### Football (the one where you use your feet)

One of the ways I like to spend time with my middle son is by coaching his football team. I find it incredibly rewarding to see him and his teammates develop their skills, and the bonds we form as a team are truly special.

The time spent with my son around the football field has been so inspiring that it has led me to take up the hobby myself. Even though I am not very good at it, I find a great deal of enjoyment in playing the sport and it also helps me maintain my physical fitness.

Here I am at my first ever match.

#### Mountainbiking

I really enjoy mountain biking with my eldest son as it provides us with an opportunity to not only bond and spend quality time together but also to challenge ourselves physically while exploring and enjoying nature.

#### DIY

Despite these passions, I still make time to appreciate the simple pleasures of home life. As a homeowner, I enjoy taking on various DIY projects around the house, which not only helps me to relax and unwind, but also allows me to see the tangible results of my hard work. There's nothing quite like the sense of satisfaction that comes from completing a challenging task with my own two hands.
